Developing data products (shiny app)

This repo uses a data set obtained and described here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG. 
The app allows the user to input specifics about their vehicle and obtain an estimated MPG based on a GLM prediction algorithm. 
Users can pick their vehicle attributes. Once they hit submit, the app returns their vehicles predicted MPG. 
This repo contains the following additional files:
1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
3. Project.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation describing the shiny app
4. Data Products Project.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file, and generates the presentation hosted on RPubs.
